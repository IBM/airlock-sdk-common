/**
 * This packages includes util classes that refer to single classes from the JUnit 4 framework
 * (http://junit.org/junit4/).
 * <p>
 * 
 * Each of these util classes consists of code duplicated from its original class to make it
 * accessible and reusable in custom extensions of the framework. Such an extension would be the
 * {@link com.github.peterwippermann.junit4.parameterizedsuite.ParameterizedSuite}.
 * <p>
 * <b>For that reason the license of JUnit 4 applies to these classes. You find it in the
 * LICENSE-junit.txt file included in this package or at http://junit.org/junit4/license.html.</b>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Endeavours to refactor the framework in order to make the code accessible in the original classes
 * didn't succeed (https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1338 and
 * https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/pull/1348). Thus the code has been duplicated in this place.
